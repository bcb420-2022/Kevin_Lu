      Alveolar Lung Mucosa Models: Implications for Pathogenicity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The SARS-CoV-2 spike protein mediates attachment of the virus to the 
      host cell receptor and fusion between the virus and the cell membrane. The S1 
      subunit of the spike glycoprotein (S1 protein) contains the angiotensin converting 
      enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor binding domain. The SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern contain 
      mutations in the S1 subunit. The spike protein is the primary target of neutralizing 
      antibodies generated following infection, and constitutes the viral component of 
      mRNA-based COVID-19 vaccines. METHODS: Therefore, in this work we assessed the 
      effect of exposure (24 h) to 10 nM SARS-CoV-2 recombinant S1 protein on 
      physiologically relevant human bronchial (bro) and alveolar (alv) lung mucosa models 
      cultured at air-liquid interface (ALI) (n = 6 per exposure condition). Corresponding 
      sham exposed samples served as a control. The bro-ALI model was developed using 
      primary bronchial epithelial cells and the alv-ALI model using representative type 
      II pneumocytes (NCI-H441). RESULTS: Exposure to S1 protein induced the surface 
      expression of ACE2, toll like receptor (TLR) 2, and TLR4 in both bro-ALI and alv-ALI 
      models. Transcript expression analysis identified 117 (bro-ALI) and 97 (alv-ALI) 
      differentially regulated genes (p ≤ 0.01). Pathway analysis revealed enrichment of 
      canonical pathways such as interferon (IFN) signaling, influenza, coronavirus, and 
      anti-viral response in the bro-ALI. Secreted levels of interleukin (IL) 4 and IL12 
      were significantly (p < 0.05) increased, whereas IL6 decreased in the bro-ALI. In 
      the case of alv-ALI, enriched terms involving p53, APRIL (a proliferation-inducing 
      ligand) tight junction, integrin kinase, and IL1 signaling were identified. These 
      terms are associated with lung fibrosis. Further, significantly (p < 0.05) increased 
      levels of secreted pro-inflammatory cytokines IFNγ, IL1ꞵ, IL2, IL4, IL6, IL8, IL10, 
      IL13, and tumor necrosis factor alpha were detected in alv-ALI, whereas IL12 was 
      decreased. Altered levels of these cytokines are also associated with lung fibrotic 
      response. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, we observed a typical anti-viral response in 
      the bronchial model and a pro-fibrotic response in the alveolar model. The bro-ALI 
      and alv-ALI models may serve as an easy and robust platform for assessing the 
      pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern at different lung regions.
