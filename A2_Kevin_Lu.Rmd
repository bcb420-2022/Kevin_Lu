## Differential gene expression

1. Calculate p-values for each of the genes in your expression set. How many genes were significantly differentially expressed? What thresholds did you use and why?
1. Multiple hypothesis testing - correct your p-values using a multiple hypothesis correction method. Which method did you use? And Why? How many genes passed correction?
1. Show the amount of differentially expressed genes using an MA Plot or a Volcano plot. Highlight genes of interest.
1. Visualize your top hits using a heatmap. Do you conditions cluster together? Explain why or why not.

## Thresholded over-representation analysis

1. Which method did you choose and why?
1. What annotation data did you use and why? What version of the annotation are you using?
1. How many genesets were returned with what thresholds?
1. Run the analysis using the up-regulated set of genes, and the down-regulated set of genes separately. How do these results compare to using the whole list (i.e all differentially expressed genes together vs. the up-regulated and down regulated differentially expressed genes separately)?

## Interpretation

1. Do the over-representation results support conclusions or mechanism discussed in the original paper?
1. Can you find evidence, i.e. publications, to support some of the results that you see. How does this evidence support your results.
